Whispering Valley is a tiered digital mental wellness platform to help Munich-based students manage emotional stress and social pressure by offering an anonymous peer forum and
personalized self-reflection tools.


  Project ideas
Whispering Valley is a caring online space where you can share your thoughts in forums, keep a private journal of your feelings, and find comfort - as if you are whispering your
worries into a peaceful valley that gently echoes back.
  Customer Segments
Whispering Valley creates value for university students in Munich who experience academic stress, emotional fatigue, and social pressure. This group often lacks timely access to
psychological services and seeks alternative forms of emotional support.
Our users share a common need for psychological well-being, but differ in how they prefer to engage with support tools. At the foundational level, we support students who benefit from
community interaction through anonymous forums - offering a broad and low-barrier space for expression and connection. For those seeking deeper self-awareness and personal
growth, we provide a more tailored experience through journaling tools and reflective feedback based on emotional input.
By accommodating both shared and growing needs, the platform supports a continuum of emotional engagement - from peer expression to guided self-reflection. It serves a niche and
behaviorally segmented market of digitally native university students with distinct emotional support preferences.
  Value Propositions
Our platform delivers a dual-layered value proposition designed to support students' mental well-being while respecting their need for privacy, autonomy, and convenience.
At the Essential Access level, users can participate in an anonymous online forum where they are free to share their emotions, struggles, and thoughts without fear of judgment. This
safe space fosters peer-to-peer empathy and emotional expression, which are crucial for reducing feelings of isolation and stress - particularly among students facing academic and personal challenges.
The Premium Tier enhances the support experience by offering a private, secure emotional journaling feature that enables users to record their daily thoughts and mood questionnaires.
Based on these entries, the platform provides real-time, emotionally-aware feedback in the form of encouraging messages and thoughtful prompts. These reflections are designed to be
empathetic, gentle, and responsive to the user's emotions. Additionally, the platform generates periodic emotional wellness reports that summarize trends and provide users with
a sense of emotional progress. In cases of potential signs of deeper distress, it may gently suggest self-care strategies or external resources, without being intrusive.
Throughout both tiers, user privacy is treated as a foundational principle rather than a feature. The platform is designed to offer a secure and non-intrusive experience, enabling
users to engage openly while maintaining full control over their emotional space. We are deeply committed to creating an environment where users feel safe, respected, and
emotionally supported, without compromising their personal boundaries.
  Customer relationships
Customers expect a relationship that is private, personalized, and secure. Students seek a trustworthy web platform where they can express their emotions freely, without additional
concerns about privacy or judgment. We offer three core services: self-service, automated services, and community.
For free users, the platform provides a community with clear guidelines that allow students to post and comment anonymously on emotion-related content connected to their daily lives in
Munich. This community is designed to foster open expression without fear of judgment or distraction from unrelated topics.
For subscribed users, the platform offers self-service features, including a private journaling tool where users can record their thoughts and feelings. Additionally, subscribers can complete regular questionnaires to assess their mental well-being.
Besides that, our automated services deliver personalized encouragement messages, derived from labels and categorizations of users’ journals. Our platform also generates
detailed emotional analysis reports, combining questionnaire data with sentiment detection from journal entries. These automated services simulate a semi-therapeutic experience,
offering users emotional support and relief without the typical waiting times associated with professional appointments.
Overall, the platform’s continuous and personalized services foster a sense of belonging and  acceptance, which naturally encourages the transition from free users to paying subscribers.
  Channels
Our target customers—university students—primarily obtain information and communicate through digital platforms, while also frequently gathering on campus.
To effectively reach this audience, our marketing strategy focuses first on digital promotion, using platforms such as an official Instagram account and targeted WhatsApp group advertisements. These channels allow us to engage students in the spaces where they are
most active online. Digital promotion is the most cost-effective among our channels and highly responsive, making it suitable for reaching a digitally native audience
In addition, on-site advertising will play a key role in boosting our visibility within the university environment. Posters and flyers will be strategically placed in high-traffic areas,
including campus buildings, student apartments, and cafeterias, to ensure maximum exposure and brand awareness.
We will also encourage students to invite their friends to join the platform. Peer recommendations are a powerful trust-building tool that can create strong first impressions and foster organic growth.
To deepen engagement, our promotional content will align closely with students’ daily experiences. Special posts tailored to exam periods, holidays, and local weather conditions in Munich will keep our messaging timely, relevant, and relatable.
Key Activities
The platform’s success depends on key activities across development, user engagement, and ethical safeguarding. Ongoing technical development - including backend infrastructure,
front-end design, journaling features, and the reporting engine - is fundamental. Forum moderation is also critical, combining automated filters with human oversight to maintain
safety while ensuring user anonymity. A major activity involves processing user input in the Premium Tier to deliver personalized, supportive reflections that foster self-awareness and resilience. The feedback must remain
non-judgmental, encouraging, and context-sensitive. Ensuring user privacy is a continuous priority. In parallel, outreach efforts - such as partnerships with university counseling services and awareness campaigns - play a key role in user growth and trust-building.
  Key Resources
The successful development and operation of the platform require a combination of critical human and technical resources. A skilled development team - comprising front-end and back-end engineers as well as data scientists - is essential. Equally important are trained
community moderators, responsible for managing sensitive forum content and ensuring a safe and inclusive environment. On the technical side, the platform depends on a robust
infrastructure, including scalable databases and secure authentication mechanisms to safeguard user identities and emotional records. Additionally, social media assets such as an official Instagram account serve as important outreach tools for engagement and the  promotion of mental health awareness. Together, these resources form the foundation of a
trustworthy, emotionally intelligent, and secure digital space for students.
  Key partners
Our key partners include mental health services, student councils, academic advisors, and ZHS (Zentraler Hochschulsport München), all of whom contribute to the platform’s credibility and outreach.
We collaborate with Studentenwerk München by integrating their official mental health resources into our platform, facilitating student access to professional support. A frequently
updated Q&A section further addresses common concerns and guides students toward appropriate services. Student councils and academic advisors support user engagement by
helping us align our offerings with student needs. In partnership with ZHS (Zentraler Hochschulsport München), we promote physical activity
as a complementary approach to mental wellness, encouraging students to adopt self-care practices.
